# DoorDash
Interview Exercise

Features:

- Uses Retrofit 2.0 and GSON to consume DoorDash APIs.
- Uses Google Maps API for user configurable nearby query.
- Uses FusedApi location services to determine current location.
- Material designed theme using Butterknife for view injection
    - Nearby restaurant search in Floating Action Button.
    - Favorites list via action bar.

Notes (aka given more time, I would do this):

- Sorted Restaurants alphabetically.
- Heavier code commenting/Java docs.
- Optimizing UI layouts (i.e. include tag).
- Add application icon.
