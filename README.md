# DoorDash
Interview Exercise

Features:

- Uses Retrofit 2.0 and GSON to consume DoorDash APIs.
- Uses Google Maps for user configurable location request.
- Uses FusedApi location services to determine current location.
- Material designed theme with nearby restaurant search in Floating Action Button and favorites list via action bar.

Notes (aka given more time, I would do this):

- Sorted Restaurants alphabetically.
- Heavier code commenting/Java docs.
- Reusing UI layouts via <include> tag.
